Country Hangman Game
This Python script is a simple GUI-based game built with Tkinter, where the player tries to guess the name of a country. It's a classic hangman game with a twist - the words to guess are all country names.

How to Play
Upon launching the game, you are presented with a series of underscores representing each letter of the country's name you need to guess. You have a certain number of chances to guess the letters correctly. Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman figure being drawn. The game ends when either the player guesses the country correctly or the hangman figure is fully drawn.
